Car Wash Booking App
Overview

The Car Wash Booking App is a web application designed to allow users to book car wash services conveniently. The application is divided into two main components:

Frontend: Built using React, providing the user interface for booking services.

Backend: Developed with Node.js and Express, handling API requests and managing data.

Both components are deployed separately to ensure scalability and maintainability.

Development Setup
Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js
 (version 14 or higher)

npm
 (Node package manager)

Git

Visual Studio Code
 (or any preferred code editor)

Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/vin2075/car_washRepo.git
cd car_washRepo

Install Dependencies

For the backend:

cd backend
npm install


For the frontend:

cd ../frontend
npm install

Run the Application Locally

Start the backend server:

cd backend
npm start


Start the frontend development server:

cd ../frontend
npm start


The frontend will be accessible at http://localhost:3000, and the backend API will run on http://localhost:5000.

Deployment
Backend Deployment

The backend is deployed on Render
, a cloud platform for hosting web applications.

Create an account on Render and log in.

Click on "New" and select "Web Service".

Connect your GitHub repository and select the backend directory.

Configure the build and start commands:

Build Command: npm install

Start Command: npm start

Set the environment variables as needed (e.g., database URLs, API keys).

Click "Create Web Service" to deploy.

Frontend Deployment

The frontend is deployed on Vercel
, a platform for frontend frameworks and static sites.

Create an account on Vercel and log in.

Click on "New Project" and import your GitHub repository.

Select the frontend directory.

Vercel will automatically detect the React framework and set the build settings:

Build Command: npm run build

Output Directory: build

Click "Deploy" to launch the application.

After deployment, your frontend will be accessible at a Vercel-provided URL, such as https://car-wash-repo.vercel.app/.

Notes

Ensure that the backend API is accessible to the frontend by configuring appropriate CORS settings.

For production deployments, consider using environment variables to manage sensitive information securely.

Regularly update dependencies to maintain security and performance.
